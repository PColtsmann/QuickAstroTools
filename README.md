Short functions for simple astronomical tasks.

## Contamination.py contains a function that:

Provides an estimate for probabilities of background galaxies contaminating your unbiased pointed surveys.

## Rotation.py contains functions that:

Rotate an orbit/point of interest into and out of a model reference frame from an external (e.g. sky image) frame.

## SkyScale.py contains a function that:

Allows easy calculation of astronomical scales using a variety of units.

## StarCount.py contains a function that:

Estimates the number of each type of star in a volume of specified direction and area/radius/side and depth.

## StellarEstimates.py contains a function that:

Searches for stellar types that have similar properties to that specified.
Given two of spectral type, distance and apparent magnitude will calculate the other.

## VelocityEstimator.py contains a function that:

Returns maximum radial velocity (i.e. keplerian velocity) of object around another massive object.

## MamajekTable.txt:

Provides table of stellar properties for use in StellarEstimates.py.
